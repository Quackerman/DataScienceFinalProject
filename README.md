# DataScienceFinalProject
In the final project, I analyze the spells of Dungeons & Dragons, finding their main traits and trends. The purpose of this project is to determine the relevance of certain game mechanics for designers of RPGs, as well as more deeply explore the game design of D&D. Here are the main questions the project tries to answer:
#### What is the average spell level?
#### What types of components are required to cast spells? What types are most common?
#### What percentage of spells are rituals?
#### What is the average casting time for a spell?
